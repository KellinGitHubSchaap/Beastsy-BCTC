## Whats Beastsy (BCTC or Bitmap Converter To C)?
Because I am making a framework project in C++, I needed to make sure that I was able to create bitmaps and be able to use them inside of my environment.
And since I don't like to convert .bmp's on sketchy websites, of which I don't know what data I'll get when converting, I quickly wrote my own converter that will handle this for you (and me =P).

## What do you need to do!
1. Open the Beastsy (BCTC or Bitmap Converter To C) program<br>

2. Click on `Import`<br>

3. Choose an image that you want to import (.bmp ONLY)<br>

4. Once imported, click on `Convert`<br>

5. If all went well you can now see a file appear on your `C:\Users\Desktop\` with your .bmp now as a .h (header).<br>

Hopefully this helped a bit =)
